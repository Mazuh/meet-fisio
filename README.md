# Meet Fisio

> Browser extension for helping my physical therapist in our Meet sessions with counters and other helpers. Just a simple and straightforward tool.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And it was made to be a Chrome extension, so it might not work so good in different browsers.

## Setting up

Using Node 18, install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Then make it run:

```
npm start
```

That's it.
